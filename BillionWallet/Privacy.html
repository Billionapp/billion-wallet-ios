            <ul>
                <li><span style="color: #ffffff;">We do not collect or have access to users private and / or personal information. We do not actively track users in any way.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Tracking information refers to information that could be used to record a user&rsquo;s activity or otherwise tie their real-world identity to their activity online.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Public Payment Information refers to payment information generated in compliance with Bitcoin Improvement Proposal â„–47 (BIP-0047). By design, such payment information CANNOT be used to track user's financial transactions on Bitcoin network and SHOULD NOT be classified as tracking information. Optional information that represents user's identity such as avatar or pseudo-name falls under a 'Public Payment Information' term.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Public Payment Information can be used by the software outside the scope of Bitcoin payments (e.g. generation of anonymous identities, encryption).</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="privacy-block animation-bottom animation">
            <h2 class="privacy-block-title"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Information users may choose to share</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Users MAY install and use the Billion Bitcoin Wallet on iPhone without sharing any Public Payment Information.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Users MAY choose to publish their Public Payment Information to publicly available repositories maintained by third parties, or decentralised repositories.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Users who do not wish to publish their Public Payment Information can refrain from publishing it and use the wallet functionality without any limitations.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Any emails and/or other messages we receive to our customer support centre will be visible to certain Billion Bitcoin Wallet support centre employees.

            <h2 class="privacy-block-title"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Information being collected</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="color: #ffffff;">When users transact on Bitcoin network using Public Payment Information of other users, the software generates a special 'Notification Transaction' that will be received by the recipient of the subsequent Bitcoin transaction. Such a transaction contains a so-called 'Notification Address' or 'Payment code identifier' of recipient's Public Payment Information that persists in Bitcoin blockchain after transaction is confirmed by the network.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color: #ffffff;">When Billion Bitcoin Wallet is set up, an obfuscated identifier is derived from a wallet's recovery phrase, account is registered on a server maintained by Evolution Group Limited and anonymous unique device id is assigned to a device for the purpose of devices differentiating. Further authentication into account is proceeded with a use of cryptographic signatures.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Public Payment Information is collected during wallet account creation and may be explicitly updated by user by providing additional information scuh as avatar and / or pseudo-name.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Billion Bitcoin Wallet makes a back-up of some meta-information user inputs during the use of the software (e.g. transaction comments, other users Public Payment Information). This information is stored on a cloud service provided by the operating system, under a user account not operated by Evolution Group Limited.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><span style="color: #ffffff;">If a user granted the corresponding system permissions, the Billion Bitcoin Wallet app uses device camera or media library to scan or import QR codes or other visual codes. All processing and recognition of QR codes and other visual codes is done WITHIN THE DEVICE and NO pictures or videos from the camera or media library are ever sent outside the device. If no permission was granted, the QR code scanning and/or other visual codes recognition functionality is unavailable to user.</span></li>
